# odin-recipes
In this project I will be applying and reinforcing the HTML skills I've learned through The Odin Project so far.
I will refresh how to create and clone a repository, how to create a website with an index site and sub-sites as well as how to implement links and images and finally how to fix bugs and write satisfactory commit messages.
