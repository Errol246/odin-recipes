        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>The Spanish tortilla, known as tortilla de patatas in the vernacular, is a Spanish potato omelette. It is an incredibly simple recipe with few ingredients, but it makes for a hearty and traditional, delicious Spanish dish that is well loved by its inhabitants.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Potatoes</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut your potatoes into very thin slices, preferably as equally sized as possible</li>
            <li>Fill a deep non-stick pan with olive oil, turn on the stove at medium heat and add the potatoes once the oil is hot enough â€“ add them very carefully to prevent splashing of hot oil</li>
            <li>Cook the potatoes in the oil at medium-low heat for about 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Set aside the cooked potatoes and cover with tinfoil for 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Add your beaten eggs to the mixture, and then add it back into the pan on medium heat</li>
            <li>Cook for 4 minutes on one side, then use a plate bigger than the size of the pan to flip the tortilla and return it to the pan with the uncooked side facing down</li>
            <li>Cook for another 2-3 minutes, remove the tortilla using the same method and let it cool down for a couple of minutes</li>
            <li>Cut it into pieces and enjoy</li>
        </ol>
